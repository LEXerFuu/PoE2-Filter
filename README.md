# PoE2 EA filter Edit by LEXerFuu
 
Original cdr's PoE2 endgame loot filter
https://github.com/cdrg/cdr-poe2filter
 
>**rLEX_PoE2.filter** for all late game content, e.g. waystone level 1 - level 15+

~80% of features are equivalent to NeverSink Path of Exile filter 1
- Manage all known PoE2 items by name clearly
- Economy tiering for all currencies, special items, etc.
- Note: Due to lack of API resources, economy tiering is rarely or never updated
- Progression for waystone, uncut gems, etc.
- Tiering of all bases

Currently, there is hardly anything hidden except for the worst normal/magical bases

We recommend you to adjust to your own preferences

Hide items at your own risk, tiering is not perfect and values â€‹â€‹can change quickly


Built on NeverSink's PoE1 filter architecture https://www.filterblade.xyz/
Path of Exile 2 support coming in a few weeks
